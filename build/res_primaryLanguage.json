      "description": "I am Mansi Mistry, a recent graduate from Stevens Institute of Technology with a Master of Science in Computer Science, specializing in cloud computing. My journey in technology is marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and practical application. I have honed my skills across various languages such as Python, C++, JavaScript, and technologies including AWS, Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes. ",
      
      "description2": "My industry experience includes significant roles where I have led projects to optimize processes, enhance user experiences, and develop efficient systems. At Stevens, I collaborated with the Systems team to migrate student records to Workday, developed complex database queries, and automated data collection processes. During my tenure at Persistent Computer Services and The Sparks Foundation, I designed and implemented applications that resulted in significant operational cost reductions and improved user engagement. My projects reflect my ability to leverage modern technologies to solve real-world problems, from developing a live football statistics app using React.js and GraphQL to enhancing system performance with Azure Kubernetes Service. As I actively seek full-time opportunities to further hone my skills and embark on innovative projects, I invite you to explore my portfolio and witness firsthand my journey in the dynamic world of technology.",
